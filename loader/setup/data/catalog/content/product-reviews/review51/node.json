    "body": "Cupcakes are so so.  Don't expect fancy for the price.  They are like something a good baker does in her kitchen. Not what you expect for the price they charge. Some are decent. Strawberry and red velvet are good. Many of the chocolate were terrible very dry.  It's hit or miss when choosing the flavors. Disappointing when you realize it's another miss when I try new flavors. I have tried them several tines and been disappointed each time.",
