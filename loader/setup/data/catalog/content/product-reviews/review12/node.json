    "author": "dean.martin",
    "body": "I didnâ€™t know what death by chocolate actually meant, but I knew I wanted to achieve something with different textures and flavors to highlight the amazing entity that is chocolate.  I ended up choosing a dark chocolate cupcake with a chocolate mousse filling topped with a chocolate buttercream frosting and bits of bittersweet chocolate.  These cupcakes were met with rave reviews and I was very pleased with the end product.",
