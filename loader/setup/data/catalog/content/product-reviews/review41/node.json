    "body": "I love cupcakes but I am extremely picky. I have had other cupcakes but they do not compare with the Tango Mango cupcake. The cupcakes are just right with the sweetness level, not too sweet. The frosting to cake proportions are also spot on and the actual crumb structure is moist but still light and airy. When I first purchased one they were so attractive that I wasn't sure they could taste as amazing as they look, they do!",
