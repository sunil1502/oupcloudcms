    "body": "The cupcake is adorable, colorful, enchanting, and fun to explore. The prized Monster cupcakes are displayed in pretty glass cabinets that the cupcake attendant opens once you decide which flavors you want to indulge in. As for the cupcakes....the buttercream frosting is yummy.  A 8.5 on a scale of 1- 10! The cupcakes themselves are not dry but they are not super moist either (personally I like mine very moist but I still enjoy these cupcakes).",
