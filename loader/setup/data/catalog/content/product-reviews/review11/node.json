    "author": "johnny.carson",
    "body": "These were freaking delicious! There are mixed reviews that say they were too dry? Honestly I have no idea what these people were doing wrong...? They weren't light and fluffy it's true - but they were super good and moist- they should be called Chocolate Brownie Cupcakes because they are definitely more dense like a Brownie - but who doesn't love a good brownie? I used creamcheese icing and they came out so well. I followed the recipe exactly and baked them 20 min. Perfection!",
