# cURL examples

This folder provides a few sample scripts that show you how to use cURL to retrieve content from Cloud CMS.

The scripts here are written in bash and use cURL to connect to Cloud CMS and pull down content.
This demonstrates how to do the OAuth 2.0 handshake as well as pass the access token to the Cloud CMS API.

These sample scripts utilize JQ to parse the JSON response within bash.
You will need to install this ahead of trying these out.
