# jQuery Example - Show a Cupcake

This directory provides a simple HTML web page that displays a cupcake from the sample project.

While this example does not use Node.js at runtime, it does use Node.js for tooling and so you will need to install
Node.js to build things.

To try out this example:

1.  Edit the public/js/sample.js file to include your API keys.
2.  Run the following:

    npm install
    npm start

3.  Open a browser to:

    http://localhost:3000

That's it!

Notes:

This example sets up a proxy server located at /proxy.  The proxy server simply chunnels requests from the locally
running server over to http://api.cloudcms.com.  By using /proxy, your requests do not go cross-domain and you avoid
many of the issues associated with cross-domain access within browser running applications.

In your own production apps, you will need to solve for CORS (cross domain) yourself.  This is usually done within
an Apache or Nginx server configuration.  For the purposes of this sample, we provide a simple local web server
to make this work for you.

Some browsers, such as Chrome, will not persist cookies properly if you're using localhost.  For those browsers, you
may need to use an alternate host name (which you can generally set by editing your /etc/hosts file).  For example,
you might map testserver to 127.0.0.1 and then access the running sample at:

    http://testserver:3000
